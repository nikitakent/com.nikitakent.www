        <h1>/abt</h1>
        <p>I use algorithms and game theory to improve markets of any kind. I am particularly interested in internet-based market applications, including high frequency trading, blockchain tokenomics, and improving liquidity in general (sorry, not sorry!!)</p>

        <p>Previously, I was an analyst at Elevation Capital Management and interned at the United Nations secretariat. In 2022, I left New Zealand to pursue a Master's degree in Market Design at the University of Tokyo. In 2024, I wrote my thesis titled "Patent platform shows improvements in social welfare and profits" under the supervision of Prof. Shunya Noda.</p>

        <p>I have spoken at several conferences and government initiatives, including the New Zealand parliament, Latin America CAPE, Otago Foreign Policy School, SusHi Tech and the APEC leaders forum. I have also led and executed media partnerships with Blockchain New Zealand, Lane Neave lawyers, Association for Women in Crypto, Easy Crypto, Trezor hard wallets, WebX Asia, among others.</p>
        
        <p>Currently I am focussed on product/strategy engineering with AltX Research where I spend my time happily doing a bunch of different things with blockchains, cryptography, stablecoins, and identity in Japan.</p>
